# smartlock-subset
This repo showcases how Google Smart Lock can be implemented on a website. It uses the [Credential Management API](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/), available on Chrome 51 and up, to store or retrieve the user's credentials. Upon sign-in, the user will be prompted a choice to store the credentials. If the user accepted to store the credentials, then the next time the user visits the site and the user's session is expired the user will be automatically signed in.
